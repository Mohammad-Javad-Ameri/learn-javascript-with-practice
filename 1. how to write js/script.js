//you can see how this js file is connected to html file in index.html

//if you want to place script taq at the top of html document:
//defer & async
/*
add defer attribute no value to a html script element to start downloading script file while move on and parsing Dom
add async attribute no value to a html script element to start downloading script file while move on and parsing Dom
with async script file may execute in the middle of parsing dom but defer wait till the end so the defer is better
